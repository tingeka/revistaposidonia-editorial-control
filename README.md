# Revista Posidonia - Editorial Control

This is a WordPress plugin designed for editorial control.

## Overview

This WordPress plugin provides an editorial control system for the Revista Posidonia website. Its primary function is to create a dedicated settings page within the WordPress admin dashboard, where users can manage and configure various custom-made features and settings. This page is built using React, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface, while a REST API endpoint is registered on the PHP side to facilitate seamless data exchange between the frontend and the server.
